This is all LGPLv2.1
If you want a different license, like BSD, just ping me and we can see what we
can work out.

TL;DR
For Linux but should be trivial to make work for Windows too. Patches welcome.
Connect PSP to your Linux box via USB, then run:

   ./pop-fe.py --psp-game-dir /run/media/..wherever-the-psp-sdcard-shows-up../PSP/GAME/   ...path-to-your-ps1-game../game.cue

Result:
Nice EBOOT.PBP with a boxart and a nice background image installed on your PSP (or vita).

Enjoy.



POP-FE:
=======
A utility to automate building and installing PSX games onto different
systems.
The current directory where you run this utility from needs to be writable
so that we can use it to store temporary files during the conversing process.
It supports and can convert games stored in the following types of file
formats:

.cue   : CUE file. The preferred option. The actual image file is extracted
         from the content of the cue file. If the file-name found inside the
         cue is a relative path it is assumed that the bin/img file is stored
         in the same directory as the cue file.
.bin   : BIN/IMG files. In this case a temporary .cue file will be created
.img     in the local directory and used for the conversion. This cue file
         will assume that the bin/img file is just one single track of type
         MODE2/2352
.zip   : ZIP file. The ZIP file will be extracted into the local directory
         and if a .cue file is found it will be used.
.*     : Various memory card image formats.
         Memory cards are detected by file size so the extensions does not
	 matter.

The utility supports building and installing the games on various different
target platforms:
--psio-game-dir <path> : This specifies the path to where a PSIO sd card has
                         been mounted. The games will be be installed as
                         <path>/<game-title>/<game-title>.bin
                         If you list more than one file it is assumed these
                         are all the disks part of a multidisc game and
                         MULTIDISC.LST will be created accordingly.
                         If you have installed cue2cu2.py in the same
                         directory as pop-fe.py then a .cu2 file will be
                         created as well.
--psp-dir <path>      : This specifies the path to where a PSP sd card has
                        been mounted. The games will be converted into
                        an EBOOT.PBP and will be installed as
                        <path>/PSP/GAME/<game-id>/EBOOT.PBP
                        The EBOOT.PBP will have a cover icon as well as a
                        background image embedded.
			If you specify multiple images then a single multi-disk
			EBOOT.PBP will be created.
--retroarch-game-dir  : The directory where retroarch game images are to be
                        installed.
--retroarch-thumbnail-dir : Where the coverimage for retroarch should go.
#
Examples:
Assume I have connected my PSP with USB and it is shows up as :
   /run/media/sahlberg/disk
   
# ./pop-fe.py --psp-game-dir=/run/media/sahlberg/disk/PSP/GAME/ /psx/Metal\ Gear\ Solid\ VR\ Missions.cue

If you specify more than one cue file then it is assumed that this is
a multidisc game and we will use the first cue file to determine the
game id and title to be used for the whole set.

Example:
 # ./pop-fe.py --psp-game-dir /run/media/sahlberg/disk/PSP/GAME/ /psx/Grandia\ -\ Disc1of2/Grandia1of2.img /psx/Grandia -\ Disc2of2/Grandia2of2.img

During the conversion process the img/bin file will be temporarily converted
into an ISO file as NORMAL01.iso in the current directory.
This is in order to open the iso9660 image and read the system.cnf file
to extract the game id.
You can avoid/skip this step by forcing the game-id from the command line,
using (example only):
    --game-id=SLUS00957
    
Game art and images are fetched from https://psxdatacenter.com/
If a file ICON0.PNG is found in the game directory it assumed to be the
cover image and thus we skip pulling it from psxdatacenter.
Similarly, if PIC1.PNG is found then it is assumed to be a screenshot
or background image and again we skip pulling this file from the site.


Installing Memory Card images on PSP
====================================
Most memory card image formats are supported.
To provide a memory card image to install along with the the game
you just add the filename to the list of images.
The file extension does nto matter as we detect the memory cards by file size.
Some platforms, such as PSP, require a two step process to install the
memory cards so follow the onscreen instructions carefully.

Example:
   ./pop-fe.py --psp-dir /run/media/sahlberg/disk/ Crash.cue Crash.srm


You can also install a memory card image directly for am already installed
game. But before this works, you must have ran the game at least once
so that the PSP creates the required metadata files in the SAVEDATA
directory. Since you are not providing a disk image to determine the game-id
from you must specify game-id explicitely.

Example:
   ./pop-fe.py --psp-dir=/run/media/sahlberg/disk/ --game_id=SCUS94900 --psp-install-memory-card Crash.srm


--fetch-metadata
================
This argument will download and install ICON0.PNG, PIC1.PNG as well as the
game id and title in the directory where the game is stored.
This requires that the game directory is writeable.

VMP.PY
======
vmp.py is a utility to convert between signed VMP memory card images
(as used by PSP) and raw memory card images as created for example by
Memory Card Annihilator on the PS2.

PSIO
====
PSIO uses a varient of CUE files called CU2.
To generate a CU2 file when installing PSIO games you need to have the
CUE2CU2.PY tool installed in the same directory as POP-FE.PY.
This tool can be downloaded from :
